# Hyperfeed

**AI-enhanced research discovery through semantic feeds and hypertext navigation**

Hyperfeed was an experimental cross-platform research feed that combined semantic AI with hypertext to transform how researchers discover and navigate academic content. Built during 2024 as part of Cosmik's exploration into next-generation knowledge tools.

## Key Features
- **Semantic layer** - Aggregated discussions and sentiment around research references
- **AI-powered curation** - Filtered research content with automated semantic tagging
- **Hypertext navigation** - Non-linear exploration through interconnected researchers, posts, and concepts
- **Cross-platform aggregation** - Unified feed experience across social media platforms

## Status
This project is archived. The learnings from Hyperfeed's semantic discovery and AI-enhanced curation directly informed our current work on [Semble](https://github.com/cosmik-network/semble), a social knowledge tool built natively on ATProto.

Part of the [Cosmik](https://cosmik.network) ecosystem for collective sensemaking tools.
