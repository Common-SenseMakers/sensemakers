Not only does it bridge mainstream science and a diversity of religious traditions; if skillfully told, it makes the science story memorable and deeply meaningful, while enriching one's religious faith or secular outlook.\n\nüì∑Edward O. Wilson coined the phrase \"evolutionary epic\" in 1978.\n\n\"Epic of evolution\" seems to have originated from the sociobiologist Edward O. Wilson's use of the phrase \"evolutionary epic\" in 1978.[2][3] Wilson was not the first to use the phrase, but, due to his prominence, the modified phrase 'epic of evolution,' became widespread. In later years, he, too, used the modified phrase.\n\nNaturalistic and liberal religious writers have used the phrase in a number of texts. They have also used related phrases: Universe Story (Brian Swimme, John F. Haught), Great Story (Connie Barlow, Michael Dowd), Everybody's Story (Loyal Rue[5]), New Story (Thomas Berry, Al Gore, Brian Swimme) and Cosmic Evolution (Eric Chaisson)\n\nhttps://t.co/nSD1r1I6jh","server":"twitter.com","tootURL":"https://twitter.com/mbauwens/status/1780618156832108978"},{"id":"1780617597089669168","created_at":"2024-04-17T15:21:32.000Z","account_id":"14349894","username":"mbauwens","urls":["https://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Category:Thermodynamic_Efficiencies"],"text":"Quotation as selected  by The Alternative:\n\n* The Two Criteria to Increase the Health of the Planet:\n\n \"Valerie Brown lists two criteria that should guide human behaviour if we hope to avoid serious damage to the natural processes that maintain systemic health.

The upshot is that an old auto-oriented place must have been a sizable city before the decline of mass transit, giving it a large core to work from. This core is typically fairly walkable and dense, so transit revival would start from there.\n\nThe most successful examples I know of involve the restoration of historic railroads as modern regional lines. Germany is full of small towns that have done so; Hans-Joachim Zierke has some examples of low-cost restoration of regional lines. Overall, Germany writ large must be viewed as such an example: while German economic growth is healthy, population growth is anemic, and the gradual increase in the modal split for public transportation here must be viewed as more intensive reuse of a historic national rail network, anchored by tens of small city cores.\n\nAt the level of a metropolitan area, the best candidates for such a revival are similarly old places; in North America, the best I can think of for this are Philadelphia, Boston, and Chicago. Americans don‚Äôt perceive any of the three as especially auto-oriented, but their modal splits are comparable to those of small French cities. But in a way, they show one way forward. If there‚Äôs a walkable, transit-oriented core, then it may be attractive for people to live near city center; in those three cities it‚Äôs also possible to live farther away and commute by subway, but in smaller ones (say, smaller New England cities), the subway is not available but conversely it‚Äôs usually affordable to live within walking distance of the historic city center.

If you think the state will not perish anytime soon, and maybe turn out to be strengthened in the coming chaos (otherwise, you may have a look at Haiti on how the collapse of a state looks like),\n\nThen you have to pay attention to this:\n\n(I translated the concluding paragraphs)\n\nLouise Guillot, R√©my Seillier et Sebastien Shulz:\n\n\"These general principles could be applied to guide the different roles of public authorities (planning, redistribution, taxation, etc.) but also the transformation of their organizational methods.\n\nOrdo-communalism would call for new regulations and economic policies to organize a cooperative economy.\n\nFor example, by generalizing entrepreneurial models such as cooperative societies of collective interest, or by establishing new legislation, such as the establishment of an enforceable responsibility to maintain the commons. This responsibility to maintain the commons would require the modification of articles 1832 and 1833 of the Civil Code in order to make the company exist as a collective project, the purpose of which is neither reduced to the search for profit, nor to the simple consideration social and environmental issues, but in its responsibility to take care of the commons that it affects through its activity.\n\nThe transformation of public authorities through the logic of the commons would also lead to a move away from bureaucratic logics or logics dictated by new public management and towards more open, cooperative and democratic public institutions.\n\nAs an illustration, when Social Security was created, it carried out a mission of general interest while being administered by private law organizations which were subject to democratic governance, with the election of representatives of contributors. Despite successive reforms, Social Security constitutes a fine example of how commons thinking allows us to design ‚Äúde-stateized‚Äù administrations, organized in accordance with the principles of cooperation, shared ownership and subsidiarity.\n\nAnother example of a transformation of the administration, attempting to move away from the private management model[13], is the recent development initiated by the IGN, taking direct inspiration from the commons[14]: training of agents in the use and deployment of ‚Äúgeocommons‚Äù, contribution of public agents to the development of these open and shared (non-public) resources, cooperation with the communities maintaining these digital commons.\n\nIt is urgent to democratize the State and regain control of its reform.\n\nThe strength of the neoliberal offensive lies in the fact that it was able to make the State a weapon to organize society around the free market, productivism and consumerism. This is why it seems crucial to us to regain control of state reform. In order to build a counter-model, we must commit ourselves to methodical and strategic work to transform our public institutions, as well as existing structures and regulatory frameworks. This work is all the more urgent to face the acceleration of the privatization of the health and education sectors, the reduction of public services, the reduction of support for intermediary bodies, the financialization of the social and solidarity economy, etc.\n\nAlthough the task is colossal, it is not impossible. The State is not a monolithic bloc serving and inspired by the market. The State already plays, in many places, a role as guarantor of cooperation and solidarity. We must commit to strengthening this voice.\"\n\n(https://t.co/fomtiprnqU)","server":"twitter.com","tootURL":"https://twitter.com/mbauwens/status/1779524170830786761"},{"id":"1779517816737013876","created_at":"2024-04-14T14:31:24.000Z","account_id":"14349894","username":"mbauwens","urls":["https://thewholesocial.substack.com/p/listen-rudolf-steiner-on-building-healthy-orgs"],"text":"* Podcast reading: Rudolf Steiner on building healthy organizations\n\nhttps://t.co/dC77Z3ZHpG\n\n\"It‚Äôs not easy to work together.

Chipping away at the foundations of our civilization (human knowledge to our best understanding) for short-term \"good ends\" is immensely costly for good ends in the future. In other words, it has innumerable negative downstream consequences.\n\nExcellent quote:\n\"For anyone with a shred of awareness of human history, it should be clear how unbelievably irresponsible it is to build a system that aims to become an authoritative compendium of human knowledge (remember Google's mission statement?), but which actually prioritizes ideology over facts. History is littered with many who have tried this sort of moral flexibility \"for the greater good\"; rather than helping, they typically resulted in decades of setbacks (and tens of millions of victims).\"","server":"twitter.com","tootURL":"https://twitter.com/AnnaLeptikon/status/1762023725384286710"},{"id":"1761282997561459095","created_at":"2024-02-24T06:52:44.000Z","account_id":"550845228","username":"AnnaLeptikon","urls":["https://twitter.com/i/web/status/1761282997561459095","https://twitter.com/robkhenderson/status/1761164071808721055"],"text":"It‚Äôs also the women from dysfunctional homes and low class that look to university and culture to teach them what to do and then hear ‚Äûsex work is work‚Äú and take it an as actual career recommendation.
