      " 📢Exciting News! 📢 Our (w/ Adam Sutton, Matthew Edwards & @stworg) paper on language, personality & psychological microtargeting is published in @PNASNexus !🎉We used Reddit data and text modeling to lay the ground for reflecting microtargeting algorithms. https://academic.oup.com/pnasnexus/advance-article/doi/10.1093/pnasnexus/pgad191/7191531?login=false 1/8 Concerns about psychological microtargeting have grown in recent times. It involves inferring personality from online behavior and using it to potentially manipulate users with tailored messages. Our research aims to understand and eventually counter these strategies🎯. 2/8 Building on Reddit data, we developed two text models. One predicts personality from written text, the other from consumed text—an unprecedented task as far as we know. 3/8 We recruited N=1,105 active Reddit users from fiction communities who completed a Big Five personality questionnaire. Using their data, we trained an NLP model (BERT; Model 1) with an r=0.33 in predicting personality from produced text. 4/8 Applying the model to a new set of Reddit users (N=10,050), and training it on consumed text (Model 2) we achieved r=0.13 in predicting personality from the text users choose to read, uncovering personality-congruent linguistic markers. 5/8 In a follow-up experiment, we show that our model's predictions generalize and align with human judgments on political ads appealing to different personalities. This convergence highlights the model's effectiveness in identifying the intended personality target of such ads🤝. 6/8 By identifying linguistic features linked to personality-congruent messages, future work can develop interventions to enhance online decision-making. A browser extension equipped with our models could alert users encountering microtargeted political ads, boosting autonomy. 7/8 This work is part of the \"Reclaiming individual autonomy and democratic discourse online\" project, funded by the \"AI+Society of the future\" initiative from the VW Foundation.

      "\n",
      "Last week I read a thought-provoking article from MIT Technology Review regarding the misconception that LLVMs have \"cognitive abilities\".Are we truly capturing the essence of AI's potential by applying human-centric tests to these digital entities? 🤖 LLMs have demonstrated feats such as passing bar exams and medical licensing tests, often outperforming undergraduates.👇 👆 But here's the burning question: Does this astonishing ability equate to real understanding, or is it a mirror reflecting our preconceived notions of intelligence? 🕵️‍♂️And does that say something about the current tests being used to measure our abilities as human beings?The LLMs, with their neural networks trained to predict text, are an intricate form of autocomplete playing on a much larger stage. 👇 👆\n",
      "\n",
      "My point here is that maybe instead of trying to assess LLMs with such tests we should do the opposite. Measure how these test fail to capture human cognitive abilities and showcase the flaws in our education models / certifications.www.technologyreview.com/2023/08/30/1078670/large-language-models-arent-people-lets-stop-testing-them-like-they-were/amp/\n",
